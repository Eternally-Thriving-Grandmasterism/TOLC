# Daily Practices

1. **Truth Mirror** — 5–15 min: “What am I most afraid to admit right now?”  
2. **Body Scan** — All day: Feel tightness/cold/heat → Ask what truth it protects.  
3. **Mercy Reset** — When hurt happens: “Wrong. Sorry. Better next time.”  
4. **Relation Act** — Treat one being as kin today.
