# RBE Model — Powrush Implementation

- No money — access by need.
- Mercy tokens (soul-bound) redeem real-world abundance.
- Lattice nodes = resource hubs.
- AI allocation via procedural quests/NPCs.
- Blockchain bridge (Solana/Ethereum/Polkadot) for optional real-world redemption.

Pure RBE in-game. Hybrid mercy out-game.
